A sentinel value reduces the range of valid values that can be represented, and may require extra (often non-optimized) logic in CPU and GPU arithmetic. Common special values like NaN are not available for all data types.\n","\n","As in most cases where no universally optimal choice exists, different languages and systems use different conventions.\n","For example, the R language uses reserved bit patterns within each data type as sentinel values indicating missing data, while the SciDB system uses an extra byte attached to every cell which indicates a NA state."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EDDbv-BtFE0i"},"source":["## Missing Data in Pandas\n","\n","The way in which Pandas handles missing values is constrained by its reliance on the NumPy package, which does not have a built-in notion of NA values for non-floating-point data types.\n","\n","Pandas could have followed R's lead in specifying bit patterns for each individual data type to indicate nullness, but this approach turns out to be rather unwieldy.\n","While R contains four basic data types, NumPy supports *far* more than this: for example, while R has a single integer type, NumPy supports *fourteen* basic integer types once you account for available precisions, signedness, and endianness of the encoding.\n","Reserving a specific bit pattern in all available NumPy types would lead to an unwieldy amount of overhead in special-casing various operations for various types, likely even requiring a new fork of the NumPy package. Further, for the smaller data types (such as 8-bit integers), sacrificing a bit to use as a mask will significantly reduce the range of values it can represent.\n","\n","NumPy does have support for masked arrays – that is, arrays that have a separate Boolean mask array attached for marking data as \"good\" or \"bad.\"\n","Pandas could have derived from this, but the overhead in both storage, computation, and code maintenance makes that an unattractive choice.\n","\n","With these constraints in mind, Pandas chose to use sentinels for missing data, and further chose to use two already-existing Python null values: the special floating-point ``NaN`` value, and the Python ``None`` object.\n","This choice has some side effects, as we will see, but in practice ends up being a good compromise in most cases of interest."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0ZYbILXCFE0j"},"source":["### ``None``: Pythonic missing data\n","\n","The first sentinel value used by Pandas is ``None``, a Python singleton object that is often used for missing data in Python code.\n","Because it is a Python object, ``None`` cannot be used in any arbitrary NumPy/Pandas array, but only in arrays with data type ``'object'`` (i.e., arrays of Python objects):"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"id":"6bfstjsXFE0k"},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"SN1Q3EzqFE0l"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["array([1, None, 3, 4], dtype=object)"]},"execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["vals1 = np.array([1, None, 3, 4])\n","vals1"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Au3NpQp5FE0m"},"source":["This ``dtype=object`` means that the best common type representation NumPy could infer for the contents of the array is that they are Python objects.\n","While this kind of object array is useful for some purposes, any operations on the data will be done at the Python level, with much more overhead than the typically fast operations seen for arrays with native types:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"HaYD6qfxFE0m"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["dtype = object\n","28.1 ms ± 415 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)\n","\n","dtype = int\n","422 µs ± 23.9 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)\n","\n"]}],"source":["for dtype in ['object', 'int']:\n","    print(\"dtype =\", dtype)\n","    %timeit np.arange(1E6, dtype=dtype).sum()\n","    print()"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0Zltsv9ZFE0n"},"source":["The use of Python objects in an array also means that if you perform aggregations like ``sum()`` or ``min()`` across an array with a ``None`` value, you will generally get an error:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"id":"wYWJzj8dFE0n"},"outputs":[{"ename":"TypeError","evalue":"unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'NoneType'","output_type":"error","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mTypeError\u001b[0m                                 Traceback (most recent call last)","Cell \u001b[0;32mIn[4], line 1\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 1\u001b[0m vals1\u001b[39m.\u001b[39msum()\n","File \u001b[0;32m~/anaconda3/lib/python3.11/site-packages/numpy/core/_methods.py:49\u001b[0m, in \u001b[0;36m_sum\u001b[0;34m(a, axis, dtype, out, keepdims, initial, where)\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     47\u001b[0m \u001b[39mdef\u001b[39;00m \u001b[39m_sum\u001b[39m(a, axis\u001b[39m=\u001b[39m\u001b[39mNone\u001b[39;00m, dtype\u001b[39m=\u001b[39m\u001b[39mNone\u001b[39;00m, out\u001b[39m=\u001b[39m\u001b[39mNone\u001b[39;00m, keepdims\u001b[39m=\u001b[39m\u001b[39mFalse\u001b[39;00m,\n\u001b[1;32m     48\u001b[0m          initial\u001b[39m=\u001b[39m_NoValue, where\u001b[39m=\u001b[39m\u001b[39mTrue\u001b[39;00m):\n\u001b[0;32m---> 49\u001b[0m     \u001b[39mreturn\u001b[39;00m umr_sum(a, axis, dtype, out, keepdims, initial, where)\n","\u001b[0;31mTypeError\u001b[0m: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'NoneType'"]}],"source":["vals1.sum()"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Vn1l0VorFE0n"},"source":["This reflects the fact that addition between an integer and ``None`` is undefined."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YiYSpR2rFE0o"},"source":["### ``NaN``: Missing numerical data\n","\n","The other missing data representation, ``NaN`` (acronym for *Not a Number*), is different;
